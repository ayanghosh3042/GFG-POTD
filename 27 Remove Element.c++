// Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

// Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

// Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
// Return k.
class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        int n=nums.size();
        for(int i=0;i<n;){
            if(nums[i]==val){
                nums[i]=nums[n-1];
                n--;
            }
            else i++;
        }
        return n;
